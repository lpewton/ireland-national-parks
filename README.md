## Testing:
* This webpage was tested on the following browser: Firefox, Safari and Chrome. It worked on all of them.
* This project is responsive on all devices, it was tested through DevTools and opening it on phones, tablets and computers.
* The contrast of colors and letter sizing make the webpage easy to read and understand.
* The form works, the fields are all required and when you click on the submit button it sends you to the correct page with the right information.

## Bugs:
* When opening the project on phones, I found that the photographs were not well seen on my phone, but they were seen well on DevTools.
* Issue solved by changing all of the sizes to Viewport and Percentages instea of pixels.
* I had problems aligning the elements to the center or correctly.
* Issue was solved by discovering and learning about the "flex" attribute.
* Some bugs kept popping up while developing the website, but the were solved as the appeared

## Validator Testing:
* HTML: No errors were found when passing the code through the official W3C validator
* CSS: No errors were found when passing the code through the official W3C validator
* Accessibility: Tested the results throught the  Lighthouse test, the performance is a bit low because of the quantity of images and the lack of Javascript. This can be fixed in the future.

## Unfixed bugs:
* I tried to create a hamburger menu because the navigation bar is a bit small on phone sizes, but due to lack of time and knowledge on Java and Bootstrap, I left the webpage with the small font in the navigation bar.
